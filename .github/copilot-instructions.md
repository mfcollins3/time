## About Time

Time is a software product that helps users to plan how they are going to spend their time working on activities and tracking the time spent. Time will help users to plan and improve their time management. Time is based around the Pomodoro Technique for time management. Using Time, users can perform pomodoros and Time will provide a counter for the user and record the information on each pomodoro performed. One pomodoro is 25 minutes in duration, followed by a 5 minute break. After 4 pomodoros, the user is encouraged to take a 30 minute break before beginning the next set of pomodoros. Time also will implement the Activity Inventory for the Pomodoro Technique and will track activities that the user is assigned to and needs to complete. Time implements the planning step for the Pomodoro technique. The first pomodoro of each day is a planning pomodoro and the user will choose activities from the Activity Inventory to work on each day. The user will prioritize the activities and then will begin performing pomodoros on each activity in priority order until the activity is completed.
